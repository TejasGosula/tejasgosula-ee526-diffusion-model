# tejasgosula-bhavika-ee526-diffusion-model
Our Project Educational implementation of a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for generative modeling. This repository includes forward diffusion, noise-prediction training, and reverse sampling, developed as part of an EE526 course project.


This repository contains an educational, end-to-end implementation of a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). The project demonstrates forward diffusion, neural network–based noise prediction, and reverse diffusion sampling, with experiments on toy datasets. The implementation is designed to align with concepts covered in EE526, including probabilistic modeling, reparameterization, and gradient-based optimization.
